For our senior project, we will be focusing on solving NP-Complete problems using quantum programming. NP-Complete problems are identified as problems that no algorithm running in polynomial time can solve, yet the non-existence of such algorithm hasn’t been proven for any of the problems. We aim to demonstrate how NP-Complete problems can be solved by making use of various quantum programming algorithms such as Grover’s Algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We will be analyzing our algorithms based on metrics like quantum volume, number of gates and circuit depth.

As Quantum Programming is a fairly new topic and quantum computers are not available for everyone yet, we will be using a tool released by IBM called IBM Q which allows researchers and students to use cloud-based quantum computers to run, test algorithms and experiment with qubits. IBM also offers open-source Qiskit Library which allows you to work on quantum algorithms on your own environment. As an editor, we will be using Jupyter Notebook which makes coding in Python even easier.

Qiskit: https://developer.ibm.com/open/projects/qiskit/

Our agenda for this semester will mainly consist of extensive research on Quantum Programing to get a firm grip on the subject as we have little background knowledge. After we feel comfortable enough to continue to implementation part, we will try to implement Grover’s Algorithm to solve chosen NP-Complete problems like Traveling Salesman Problem, 3SAT and graph coloring.
